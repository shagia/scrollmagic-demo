    	<cite>— By Jen</cite>

  	<p>The Internet is finally showing signs of rejecting a Eurocentric beauty standard of pale skin, straight hair, and big eyes. But before you get excited, I’m not talking about women of color taking ownership of their beauty. It’s white women at the center of controversy for appearing on social media with brown skin, box braids, and self-imposed monolids.</p>

    <p>In November of last year, Wanna Thompson set off a riveting conversation about “blackfishing” when she tweeted about white girls posting pictures where they look progressively darker and more ethnically ambiguous.</p>

    <p>I just think it’s funny how white people think they can do it all, even be black. While white supremacist beauty standards have dominated for centuries at the expense of women of color, for nonblack folks, racial ambiguity can actually raise your profile and profits. The irony is rich — and the attention we are about to give these people is proof.

    Here we go anyway …</p>

<p>College student Aga Brzostowska was dragged into the blackfishing debate based on the striking gap between “before” and “after” shots of her that appeared on social media. She admitted to BBC news that she will tan, but not for “malicious” reasons. As an additional response, she launched a YouTube channel with a video that had over 43,000 views, last time I checked.  The video mainly addresses accusations of surgery and her use of braids, which she said she would be more careful with in the future.</p>





<p>It’s not just blackness that folks are reaching for — there is also the phenomenon of white social media users making themselves appear more East Asian. 


 For example: the white woman behind the now-defunct Instagram account scarebrat.  When challenged, her explanation transformed — much like her eyelids — from an initial excuse about camera angles giving her the appearance of a monolid, to finally admitting to altering her photos to look Korean. She deleted her Instagram account of 11,000 followers because of the fallout.</p>



<p>Emma Hallberg, a Swedish influencer, was among the first to be called out. Technically she never identified herself as black, though users would steal her photos and tag her as #africanbutter and #darkskinwoman. Many think one of her makeup tutorials incriminates her for intentionally changing her skin tone because she uses a foundation too dark for her complexion. Hallberg insists her face is simply lighter than her body and makeup is her solution.</p>

    <p>If you ask me, when you are on Instagram making money from your brand and image, you are responsible for ensuring that branding, and thus your identity, are accurate. I’m pretty sure Instagram influencers are in the habit of checking posts they are tagged in. I find it hard to believe that Hallberg never saw one of these tags assuming her identity as a black woman.  If she did, I think she has a responsibility to correct those misunderstandings promptly.</p>

    <p>Modern makeup and style trends are a big part of the blackfishing debate, too — <b>especially in the context of a our globally networked, multiethnic world.</b></p>

    <p>Jaiden Gumbayan, a Filipina and Italian influencer, complicates the narrative with her biracial identity. However, she is also a non-black woman who often wore box braids. Since the backlash, Gumbayan removed most pictures of her wearing braids and has issued a statement saying that she has a deeper understanding of why black women could feel protective of their hairstyles.
    <br><br>
    While I give Gumbayan props for learning from critiques, her story does demonstrate a non-black women’s ability to put on and off blackness as a costume, which is largely the root of the issue.</p>

    <p>What are the boundaries between creative expression, blackface, and other racially insensitive looks? <br><br>
    
    Martina Big obviously crosses the line with her rise to pseudo-fame for extreme body modification, kinky hair extensions, and skin darkening in her attempt to change into a black woman.<br><br>

    Perhaps to a less exaggerated extent, the “Instagram Baddie” aesthetic many of these girls are sporting could be a push for a racially ambiguous beauty standard. Maybe blackfishers dream of a future in which we’re all ambiguously brown? 
    </p>

    <p>That’s essentially the position Mika Francis implied when she responded to critics by saying “I feel like what this shows, if this has become a trend, [is that] white girls are, whether they’re doing it consciously or subconsciously, wanting to appear more black or mixed race.  I feel like it is because there has been a paradigm shift in what is beautiful in pop culture.”</p>

<p>It’s perplexing. These women grew up with white dolls and an abundance of white female role models in the media. Yet they have put significant effort into rejecting their own natural beauty and co-opting that of women of color. They are then celebrated for racial ambiguity.</p>

<p>The Internet offers a variety of purely aspirational beauty standards and influencer culture sells products that promise we can have them all. But I draw the line when white folks successfully obtain the coveted ethnically ambiguous beauty standard while maintaining white cultural capital.</p>

<p><i>Because that feat is impossible for any woman of color.</i></p>
